#Cpanel Installation
cpanel all you have to do is make a subdomain like go.eqtherapies.com or even l.eqtherapies.com and drop the files in they should run straight of the bat with just any minor adjustments being on constant.php or apiconfig.php...

You will also in your cpanel or domain zone depending where you setting this up have to make the wildcard as a cname goto the domain subject so say you shortlink URL is l.eqtherapies.com then you would make the cname *.l.eqtherapies.com point to l.eqtherapies.com it just shorten them in three options one is just as a subdomain...
